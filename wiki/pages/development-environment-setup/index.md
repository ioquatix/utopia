# Development Environment Setup

Utopia is built on Ruby and Rack. Therefore, Ruby (suggested 2.0+) should be installed and working. Then, simply run:

```bash
$ gem install utopia
```

To install all required dependencies.

Utopia and it's dependencies are built on Linux and Mac by default, and therefore compatibility with Windows is not guaranteed.

## Atom Integration

Utopia uses [Trenni](https://github.com/ioquatix/trenni) for templates and it has a syntax slightly different from ERB. However, there is a [package for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-trenni) which provides accurate syntax highlighting.
